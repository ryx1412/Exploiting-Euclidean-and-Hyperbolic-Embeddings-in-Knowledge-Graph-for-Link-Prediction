### original_data
It contains the original provided in https://smc-datachallenge.ornl.gov/data-challenges-2021/.

### processed_data
It contains the preprocessed data.

### tools
It contains three scripts:

train.py -d <16/64> -c <n/p> -p <n/p>. 

---run grid search on **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier** and **Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier**.

---The output is a Python dictionary recording the trained models and their evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision and F_1 score, which is saved in **/processed_data** named as **model_performance_{16/64}_c-{n/p}_p-{n/p}.pkl**.
