### oringial_data

### processed_data
It contains intermediate data used in the experiement:
1. The training instances and labels are saved in **train_instances.pkl**.  
2. Local graph data: the graph $G_{cc}$ and betweenness centrality are saved in **graph_info_500.pkl**; the Jaccard Similarity Score of the training instances are saved in **train_instances.pkl**.
3. Average embeding of related papers is saved in **concept_avg_embed_nv.pkl** and **concept_avg_embed_poincare.pkl**.
4. Embedding of concepts is saved in saved in **embedding_n2v_16.pkl**, **embedding_n2v_64.pkl**, **embedding_poincare_16.pkl**, **embedding_poincare_64.pkl**.
5. In the directory **final_model**,
